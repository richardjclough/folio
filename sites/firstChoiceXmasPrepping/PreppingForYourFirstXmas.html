                <h5>First Time Prepper: Our guide to making sure your first hosting experience isn't your last</h5>
                <p>
                  Along with finishing school and getting your drivers licence, hosting your first Christmas is a true indicator of adulthood. But unlike the other two, you don't get any training to host Christmas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But as Christmas Preppers, we're here to make sure you're prepped to take the momentous leap to being a festive host.
                </p>

                <h6>Run the numbers</h6>
                <p>
                  Start with the numbers. How many do you have coming? Are you sure that's all? Are there any hidden partners or last minute blow-ins? Never underestimate the pulling power of someone else providing food and drinks. Never.
                </p>

                <p>Once you lock down the number, you can start calculating the amount of food, drinks and space you'll need. </p>

                <h6>Raise a glass</h6>
                <p>Ok so you have the numbers. Do you have enough cutlery, glassware and table space for that many? If not, your options include hiring some, going disposable or doing a run to your local op shop. Mismatched saucers and classic cut glassware can make for a stylish table setting, and are easy to find in the bargain bins. You can even make it look like you planned it that way.
                </p>

                <h6>Three (or more) chairs</h6>
                <p>
                  Do you have enough chairs for the impending horde? Is your table big enough? If not, you can ask your guests to BYO, or improvise. If you're not going for a formal lunch, lay out a picnic rug for the kids, or even <a href="https://au.pinterest.com/explore/crate-seats/">top crates with cushions</a> for a casual vibe that (at least) looks planned.
                </p>

                <h6>Plan the menu</h6>
                <p>
                  There are a million options when planning a festive menu - as luxe or as simple as you like. Thankfully, there are <a href="http://www.taste.com.au/menus/christmas+menu+plans/">countless resources</a> to give you ideas for catering to a crowd. The main thing to remember are that your guests aren't expecting a five star restaurant, and that you don't automatically become a better cook on December 25. So set achievable goals, and don't be afraid to ask for help.
                </p>


                <!-- <img src="media/Images/1C_Christmas2016/Images/blogContentPhoto.jpg" alt="blog photo" > -->


                <h6>Measure up</h6>
                <p>
                  Once you've planned the menu, do an audit of your kitchen. Do you have enough pots, pans, serving trays, salad bowls and fridge space for all of the food? One trick is to lay out the serving plates and preparation implements and write each dish on a piece of paper, lay it on the required tray, plate, pot or pan. You'll quickly spot what you're missing.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Lastly, measure your oven. Are you cooking a big hunk of meat like a turkey? If so, will it fit? And will it fit with trays of potatoes alongside it? If not, maybe change your plans to something that will fit, and supplement it with ham or something that can be served cold.
                </p>

                <h6>Dry run</h6>
                <p>
                  One of the common Christmas mistakes is trying a new dish under pressure, with your impatient uncle making hungry noises at the table. So without breaking the bank, how many of the aspects of the meal can you try ahead of time? After all, your friends are likely to love you for trying out your
                  <a href="http://www.taste.com.au/recipes/28552/christmas+layer+dip?ref=collections,cooking-for-a-crowd">Christmas dip</a> or

                  on them ahead of time, right?
                </p>


                <h6>Get a jump</h6>
                <p>
                  Another useful question to ask is 'what can be prepared ahead of time?' Preparing ahead of time buys you more time to spend with your guests and wear paper hats. You'll be surprised as to what freezes. Try par-boiling and freezing potatoes ahead of time, so they only need crisping on the big day. Or make and freeze your Christmas cake or pudding.

                </p>

                <h6>Estimate, then add a few extra</h6>
                <p>
                  Your well fed guests will need to be watered as well. When buying your drinks, make an educated guess using handy tools but don&rsquo;t be afraid to add a &lsquo;just in case&rsquo; bottle of wine or slab. Unopened cartons of beer, if stored correctly, can be returned to First Choice stores, for example. And don&rsquo;t think of it in terms of beer and wine. It&rsquo;s easy to knock together something more impressive, like a <a href="http://www.taste.com.au/recipes/23801/spiced+wine+punch?ref=collections,christmas-drinks">spiced wine punch</a>, for example.</p>

                  <h6>More than the menu</h6>
                  <p>
                    Remember that the day isn&rsquo;t just about food and drink. It&rsquo;s a time to celebrate with family and friends so leave room for celebration, too. That might mean setting the tone with the right music, planning for informal backyard games like Bocce or Finska, or having a Christmas classic ready to go on the TV for when the kids need some time out. And take time to enjoy the day; you've earned it.
                  </p>
