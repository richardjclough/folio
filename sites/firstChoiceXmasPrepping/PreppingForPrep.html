                <h5>Prepping for Prep</h5>
                <p>
                  You don&rsquo;t just become a Christmas Prepper. You have to prepare for it. And that doesn&rsquo;t mean just preparing for Christmas, it means spotting things that others haven&rsquo;t thought of beyond what are the best Christmas drinks. We can&rsquo;t give you a magic checklist for every scenario, but we can teach you to think like a Prepper. And that will get you half way there.
                </p>

                <h7>Play the long game</h7>
                <p>
                  It's easy to think of Christmas as December 25. But we all know it's much, much more than that. It's the street party. It's the work drinks. It's the interstate family landing a few days early. It's knock-off drinks on the 22<sup>nd</sup>. It's Boxing Day wines. It's the events you have to go to, not just the events you're hosting. Having a cold six pack, bottle of soft drink or chilled white on hand might save you a desperate dash into a shopping centre the week before Christmas. Take a moment to go through your calendar, including your Facebook calendar, and spot the big moments in the month.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Plan for every moment, not just the December 25</li>
                    <li>Go through your calendar to spot unexpected events</li>
                  </ul>


                  <h7>No surprise is a good surprise</h7>
                  <p>Preppers don&rsquo;t like surprises, but they&rsquo;re always prepared for them. That&rsquo;s how they get the name. So there are the known occasions to look out for, but what about the unknown ones? Here is a list of surprise occasions we&rsquo;ve compiled here at Christmas Preppers HQ.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The cricket gets rained out and everyone comes back to yours. Do you have a spare slab and a few packets of chips?</li>
                    <li>The neighbours pop in with some home made slice. Do you have a bottle of Bailey&rsquo;s?</li>
                    <li>
                      You get a last-minute invite to your boss&rsquo; Chrissie barbie. Do you have a cold bottle of Riesling and a six pack of craft beer?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Boxing Day lunch turns into Boxing Day dinner. Do you have a bottle of something fortified to serve with the cheese and fruit platter. DO YOU HAVE A CHEESE AND FRUIT PLATTER?
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <h7>A Christmas storage</h7>
                  <p>Your house is a home, that&rsquo;s a given. But you also need to look at your house as Christmas Preparation Ground Zero. The Preppers ethos is, &lsquo;anything can be an esky&rsquo;. If it holds water, it holds ice. And if it holds ice, it holds beer, bubbly and soft drinks packed in ice. So your laundry sink and bathtub are obvious culprits, but what about the less obvious ones? The washing machine, for example. Will you be using it much this month? No? Then put it to work. Do you really NEED to give the guests a wardrobe? That&rsquo;s space that could be used to store the spare slabs.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>If it holds water, it holds ice</li>
                    <li>It it holds ice, it holds drinks</li>
                    <li>Drink storage is more important than guest storage</li>
                  </ul>


                  <h7>Time is your frenemy</h7>
                  <p>
                    There&rsquo;s no point having made room in the fridge or <a href="https://stuffexplained.wordpress.com/2012/08/06/adding_salt_to_ice_in_a_cooler/">salted your ice</a> if you haven&rsquo;t left enough time to get the drinks cold. When planning an event, build some time in for chilling &ndash; if in the fridge, at least <a href="http://www.foodrepublic.com/2013/07/30/how-long-does-beer-take-to-get-cold-in-the-fridge/">two hours</a>. Think of it this way &ndash; you&rsquo;d always plan to have your turkey cooked through. It&rsquo;s just as important to plan to have your beer chilled right.
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Allow two hours to chill your drinks</li>
                    <li>Build the time into your plans</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h7>You can only prep so much</h7>
                  <p>Relax. It's only Christmas. While you now have the eagle eye of a proper Prepper, don&rsquo;t forget to relax and enjoy the moment.</p>
