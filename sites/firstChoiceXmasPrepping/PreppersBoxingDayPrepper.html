                <h5>A Prepper's guide to hosting Boxing Day without the drama</h5>
                <p>
                  December 26th can be a big day - but that doesn't mean it has to be a big deal, even if you're the host. On a day when even Santa's on holiday, keep things chilled (especially the wine) with a bit of clever forward planning.
                </p>
                <p>'Tis the morning after Christmas. The gifts have been unwrapped. The relatives have been farewelled. And not a creature is stirring - except for you, slicing leftover ham with a frantic efficiency that makes
                  you look like you've got this hosting thing in the bag.</p>
                  <p>Except, uh, you don't.</p>
                  <p>But don't stress. Or at least, don't stress yet. You've got plenty of time to get prepped for your hosting duties - and a bit of planning now will pay off in spades. Here are our tips for a Boxing Day to remember
                    for all the right reasons.</p>

                    <h7>Think ahead</h7>
                    <p>Boxing Day is a funny time, shopping-wise. It's a day when you can buy a cheap fridge at the sales, but not necessarily anything to put inside it. So if your local stores are shut, get prepped well in advance
                      with drinks and freezable items like meat and bread. Then do a last minute shop for veggies, fruit and other necessities like spearmint flavoured eggnog in a carton. </p>

                      <h7>Get outside</h7>
                      <p>
                        It's summer. Depending on where you live, that could mean it's a sweltering tropical soup (Brisbane) or a chilly, disappointing fog (Melbourne). But no matter. At this time of year it's just plain wrong to stay indoors, so set up some chairs in your garden,
                        courtyard or the park down the road, and take the party outside.
                      </p>

                      <img src="img/CVC0056-Preppers-Boxing-Day-Stills-61.jpg" alt="blog photo" >

                      <h7>Be smart with leftovers</h7>
                      <p>
                        Waste not, want not. But also, poison not. So best not to store your chicken in the dog's kennel. Do your best to use up yesterday's leftovers, but be sure to check they've been refrigerated properly - within an hour of cooling. Christmas ham and turkey
                        can be sliced and served cold, or shredded into an Asian-style salad with some cabbage, spring onion, fresh herbs and chilli. For some extra inspiration, check out this

                      </p>

                      <h7>Keep it light</h7>
                      <p>
                        After the eating marathon of Christmas day, nobody will be keen for a formal five course meal. Keep things casual with a buffet of cold and hot dishes. Then simply add a spread of summer-friendly beverages - think cold soft drink,
                        <a
                        href='https://www.firstchoiceliquor.com.au/Search?q=cider' target='_blank'>crisp cider</a>, <a href='https://www.firstchoiceliquor.com.au/Search?q=moscato&facets=grapevarietymapping%3dMoscato' target='_blank'>chilled Moscato</a> and a big jug of nojitos. (That's a mojito without
                        the rum, for those with sore Boxing Day heads.)
                      </p>

                      <h7>Thou shalt grill</h7>
                      <p>
                        It's a biblical time of year, so heed our commandment and fire up the barbie. Steaks and snags are quick, easy, and they'll get you out of the kitchen and among your guests. Cut meat as thin as possible and be sure to bring it to room temperature before
                        placing on the hotplate for the perfect cooked-inside-crispy-outside combo.
                      </p>

                      <h7>Relax</h7>
                      <p>
                        Finally, remember to chill - even and especially if it's 35 degrees. Boxing Day should be a relaxed kind of holiday, not a time to show off your MasterChef skills. Keep things simple, prep beforehand and let your guests give you a hand on the day. The
                        best thing is, if it all goes pear-shaped you can all just go to the movies.
                      </p>
